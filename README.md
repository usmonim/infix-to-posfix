# infix-to-posfix
C++ program that converts arithmetic expression given in usual infix notation to postfix (by using Stack ADT) form and then evaluates the expression again using by using Stack ADT.

Program takes as an input infix expression Ex: 1 + 5 * 23 - 6 ;

Then it converts it to postfix form Ex: 1 5 23 * + 6 - ;

Finally it calculates the result which is 110;

Sample run of the program: 

Enter an arithmetic expression:

1 + 5 * 23 - 6 ;

Input expression in postfix form: 1 5 23 * + 6 - ;

The result is: 110
